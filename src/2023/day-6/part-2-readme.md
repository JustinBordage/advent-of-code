## --- Day 6: Wait For It (Part 2) ---

As the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record distances you got earlier actually just has very bad [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning). There's really **_only one race_** - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.

So, the example from before:

```
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```

...now instead means this:

```
Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
```

Now, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this example, the race lasts for `71530` **_milliseconds_** and the record distance you need to beat is `940200` **_millimeters_**. You could hold the button anywhere from 14 to 71516 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of `71503` ways!

**_How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?_**
